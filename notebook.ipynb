    "**Scenario**: A company needs to ensure that the communication between employees remains friendly by automatically detecting and censoring inappropriate words (*fuck*, *shit*, and *ass*) in real-time. When an inappropriate word is detected, the system should replace it with a censorship marking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: Build a rule-based content moderation system using regular expression. This rule-based approach is chosen due to its the following advantages over machine learning approach. First, a rule-based system is simpler and faster to implement. What is needed is a comprehensive list of defined expressions. Second, unlike ML approach, especially the black-box one, the rule-based approach is more transparent and easy to understand by the stakeholders. If matching with any defined expressions in the list, the system should censor the word. Third, as it is rule-based, every word matching those listed will be catched, making it more effective to censor the inappropriate expressions."

The function requires two arguments, i.e., `message` (message to check) and `blacklisted_words` (a list of censored words in English). In this example, the system will only handle English language even though the regex patterns can also be used to handle other languages with Latin alphabets (e.g., Indonesian, Javanese, or Sundanese).\n",

    "- `pattern = '|'.join(map(re.escape, blacklisted_words))`: This line specifies the regex pattern for detecting `blacklisted_words` in the `message` input. The function `map` applies the function `escape` from library `re` to every word in the `blacklisted_words`. The function `re.escape` serves to make sure if any special characters (e.g., dot \".\" or asterisk \"*\") are escaped. They need to be treated in a special manner as they have special purposes in regular expressions. \n",
    "    - For example, \".\" us used to match any single character. When we want to detect any single character after the word \"ball\", we can use pattern `ball.`, and it will return \"balla\", \"ballb\", or \"ballc\".\n",
    "    - In the case of asterisk (*), this regex character matches zero or more occurrences of the following elements in a string. Regex pattern `acqui*` will matches \"acquire\", \"acquiring\", \"acquired\", \"acquisition\", and so on. \n",

    "- `censored_message = re.sub(pattern, lambda m: '*' * len(m.group()), message, flags=re.IGNORECASE)`: This searches any words in `message` input matching `pattern` (previous line). If matching, Python will replace the blacklisted words with asterisk (\"*\") with the same length as the blacklisted word. And last, the `flags=re.IGNORECASE` ignores the lettercase of the word."
